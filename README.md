# Attendance System Using Machine Learning

## Introduction

The Attendance System Using Machine Learning automates attendance tracking by detecting and recognizing individuals in real-time using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. This system leverages Object Detection (YOLO) and Facial Recognition to streamline attendance recording in classrooms or workplaces.

## Problem Statement

Traditional attendance systems are often inefficient, relying on manual or biometric methods. This system automates attendance tracking by detecting individuals and logging their attendance based on real-time video feeds.

## Features

- **Real-time Attendance Tracking**: Automatically marks attendance using a camera feed.
- **YOLO Object Detection**: Detects human figures in video frames.
- **Facial Recognition**: Identifies known individuals using pre-registered facial data.
- **Attendance Logging**: Stores attendance records with timestamps in a CSV or database.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances model accuracy through image transformations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep learning models)
- OpenCV (for video processing)
- `yolov8` model (or any compatible YOLO model)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attendance-system.git
   cd attendance-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained YOLO model and save it in the `models/` directory. (Link to YOLO model)

4. Prepare your dataset (if necessary) and place it in the `dataset/` directory.

### Configuration

- Modify the `config.py` file to configure camera settings, paths, and model parameters.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The system will begin processing video frames from the camera, detecting individuals, and logging attendance.

3. The attendance data will be saved in `attendance.csv`.

## Methodology

### Object Detection with YOLO

The **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** model is used for real-time object detection. It detects human figures in video frames and provides bounding boxes and class probabilities for each detected individual.

### Facial Recognition

The system employs **transfer learning** with pre-trained models to recognize faces. Facial embeddings (using models like **FaceNet**) are compared with stored profiles to identify individuals.

### Data Augmentation

To improve model robustness, data augmentation techniques such as scaling, rotation, and translation are applied to the training dataset.

## Performance Evaluation

- **Detection Accuracy**: 78.4% mAP50, 55.7% mAP50-95
- **Precision**: 73.3%
- **Recall**: 62.5%
- **Inference Speed**: 2.1 ms per frame (near real-time performance)

## Challenges

- **Lighting Conditions**: The model's performance can degrade in low-light environments.
- **Crowded Environments**: The system may struggle with detecting individuals when they are too close to each other.
- **Occlusion**: Partial obstruction of individuals may reduce detection accuracy.

## Future Improvements

- **Face Recognition**: Enhance identification accuracy by integrating advanced face recognition models.
- **Scalability**: Improve the system to handle larger datasets and more complex environments.
- **Robustness to Variability**: Address challenges such as lighting changes, masks, and occlusions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in automating attendance systems. With YOLO for object detection and advanced facial recognition techniques, the system offers an efficient and accurate solution for real-time attendance tracking.
